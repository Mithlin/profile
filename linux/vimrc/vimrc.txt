" If you are using a console version of Vim, or dealing
" with a file that changes externally (e.g. a web server log)
" then Vim does not always check to see if the file has been changed.
" The GUI version of Vim will check more often (for example on Focus change),
" and prompt you if you want to reload the file.
"
" There can be cases where you can be working away, and Vim does not
" realize the file has changed. This command will force Vim to check
" more often.
"
" Calling this command sets up autocommands that check to see if the
" current buffer has been modified outside of vim (using checktime)
" and, if it has, reload it for you.
"
" This check is done whenever any of the following events are triggered:
" * BufEnter
" * CursorMoved
" * CursorMovedI
" * CursorHold
" * CursorHoldI
"
" In other words, this check occurs whenever you enter a buffer, move the cursor,
" or just wait without doing anything for 'updatetime' milliseconds.
"
" Normally it will ask you if you want to load the file, even if you haven't made
" any changes in vim. This can get annoying, however, if you frequently need to reload
" the file, so if you would rather have it to reload the buffer *without*
" prompting you, add a bang (!) after the command (WatchForChanges!).
" This will set the autoread option for that buffer in addition to setting up the
" autocommands.
"
" If you want to turn *off* watching for the buffer, just call the command again while
" in the same buffer. Each time you call the command it will toggle between on and off.
"
" WatchForChanges sets autocommands that are triggered while in *any* buffer.
" If you want vim to only check for changes to that buffer while editing the buffer
" that is being watched, use WatchForChangesWhileInThisBuffer instead.
"
command! -bang WatchForChanges                  :call WatchForChanges(@%,  {'toggle': 1, 'autoread': <bang>0})
command! -bang WatchForChangesWhileInThisBuffer :call WatchForChanges(@%,  {'toggle': 1, 'autoread': <bang>0, 'while_in_this_buffer_only': 1})
command! -bang WatchForChangesAllFile           :call WatchForChanges('*', {'toggle': 1, 'autoread': <bang>0})

" WatchForChanges function
"
" This is used by the WatchForChanges* commands, but it can also be
" useful to call this from scripts. For example, if your script executes a
" long-running process, you can have your script run that long-running process
" in the background so that you can continue editing other files, redirects its
" output to a file, and open the file in another buffer that keeps reloading itself
" as more output from the long-running command becomes available.
"
" Arguments:
" * bufname: The name of the buffer/file to watch for changes.
"     Use '*' to watch all files.
" * options (optional): A Dict object with any of the following keys:
"   * autoread: If set to 1, causes autoread option to be turned on for the buffer in
"     addition to setting up the autocommands.
"   * toggle: If set to 1, causes this behavior to toggle between on and off.
"     Mostly useful for mappings and commands. In scripts, you probably want to
"     explicitly enable or disable it.
"   * disable: If set to 1, turns off this behavior (removes the autocommand group).
"   * while_in_this_buffer_only: If set to 0 (default), the events will be triggered no matter which
"     buffer you are editing. (Only the specified buffer will be checked for changes,
"     though, still.) If set to 1, the events will only be triggered while
"     editing the specified buffer.
"   * more_events: If set to 1 (the default), creates autocommands for the events
"     listed above. Set to 0 to not create autocommands for CursorMoved, CursorMovedI,
"     (Presumably, having too much going on for those events could slow things down,
"     since they are triggered so frequently...)
